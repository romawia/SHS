; v1.5.5
; bah. doing the crimson fix, i messed up the crc_with_reloc code, and it seems it didnt get
;  the correct crc for unreal tourny. well, it worked with crimson, so i was happy, and didnt
;  bother testing any other games.. tested now with crimson & ut and works fine.
; couldnt leave 154 as the final because of this bug, so 155 is the final final version ever


; v1.5.4
; r.e. v1.5.1 'hopefully support for v1.50.20 with reloc info (i dont have an icd for testing)'
;  well, i got an icd, and it failed :O crimson.icd, unSafedisc really messed up and encrypted
;  the rdata section of this game, when it shouldnt have :p bug fixed for this game
; removed the part of code that creates database keyfiles


; v1.5.3
; uhm, CharLowerA (main.asm - lowercase_sections), was lowercasing v_size, if the section name
;  was 8 chars, and the first byte of v_size was between 41h - 5ah. this just causes an extra
;  few bytes to be decrypted, not a big problem, but still a bug.. duh, whats CharLowerBuff?


; v1.5.2
; oops, 1.5.1 added a bug in the crc routine, stopped unwrapping games with sections smaller
;  than 4kb (aoe2.0a, madden2001), heh, fixed it now (and hopefully no more bugs added (lol) ;)
; database updated again, 139ish keys
; probably fixed/updated some other code, but i cant remember
; decided to release the source again (due to one request)


; v1.5.1
; hopefully support added for v1.50.20 with reloc information (i dont have an icd for testing)
; bug removed in crc routine for safedisc r4 .. (and hopefully no bugs added..)
; database updated again, 129 keys for r0/r1 games...


; v1.5
; beta support added for safedisc v1.50.20 (r4, dplayerx.dll 138,752 bytes)
; database updated, contains 119 keys now :D


; v1.4
; about 480 lines of code added to compute the 128bit key, unwraps safedisc v1.45.11 (r4) now!
; doesnt work on win2k anymore (i cant load dplayerx.dll on win2k (and i dont have win2k))
; whats better, a real program or a real gui?
; does moelch hate me? who knows ..


; v1.3.4
; database updated, contains 101 keys for r0/r1 games now .. thx for all the support!


; v1.3.3
; damn it! remember brute_key_quick being optimised? it had a bug in find_first_key, caused it
   to find incorrect starting keys for a couple of game's .. algo re-wrote and working 100% now!
; r0/r1 MMX brute force routine re-wrote & kinda optimised (for amd's :)
; BIG fix by 'moelch' for games which had more than two libraries messed with by safedisc
; database updated again, now contains 77 keys for r0/r1 games!


; v1.3.2
; arrgh, tiny bug fixed in MMX engine, caused it to find the wrong key on a handful of games


; v1.3.1
; bug fixed in scan4rdata, need for speed v4.44 unwraps ok now :)
; support added for 'Demise' and hopefully ANY other VB6 games protected with safedisc
; MMX brute force engine added for r0/r1 games, moelch kindly donated the mmx code (thanks!)
; added code to fix icd pe sections that overlapped, as this stops exe running on nt/2k ..
; heh, gave up trying to tidy the code up, just chopped it up into a bunch of files..


; v1.3.0
; moelch optimised brute_key_quick, unwraps r2 / r3 games almost instantly :/
; more keys added to database (contains 44 decrypt keys :)
; source code removed from distro while i attempt to tidy it up a bit


; v1.2.2
; database format changed, more games added to it


; v1.2.1
; tiny bugs fixed in scan4reloc and a weird bug, which stopped some r1 games unwrapping
; on certain games, every sections virtual size was 0 :( ..
; began my key database . 13 byte files are created after unwrapping r0/r1 with icd crc&size&key


; v1.2
; re_fix_calls subroutine fixed for files with more than one code section
; and probably a few other lame bugs fixed :) (and safedisc is spelt correctly now..)

; http://csir.cjb.net ! 

; risc waves to yates, my beta tester :/
; and all those dudes in #cracking4newbies


; v1.1
; dec0de12's safedisc unwrapper unwrapped
; file attacked `DarkStone105b_eu_Crack.exe`
; and 'UT413_NoCD.exe' ..

; im not a criminal! (r!sc is not a criminal, honest)

; code added to fetch two missing api pointers from safedisc loader
; and to brute force the key.
; some lame gui code added aswell. (works on win2k!!)
; support for latest safedisc version added, and support for r0/r1
